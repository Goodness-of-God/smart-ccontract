### Function Analysis

### Function: permit

```solidity
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint value, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "ERR_EXPIRED_SIG");
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
            uint16(0x1901),
            DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
            keccak256(abi.encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, owner, spender, value, nonces[owner]++, deadline))
        )
    );
    require(owner == _recover(digest, v, r, s), "ERR_INVALID_SIG");
    _approve(owner, spender, value);
}
```
### Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:
- `abi.encodePacked`
- `keccak256`
- `_recover` (assumed to be a function performing signature recovery)

### Explanation

**Purpose:**
The purpose of the `permit` function is to enable off-chain approvals of ERC-20 token transfers through cryptographic signatures.

**Detailed Usage:**

- **Encoding:** Uses `abi.encodePacked` to tightly pack parameters (`owner`, `spender`, `value`, `nonce`, `deadline`) into a byte array. It includes a prefix (`uint16(0x1901)`) for compatibility with EIP-712.

- **Hashing:** `keccak256` hashes the packed data (`digest`) to produce a hash.

- **Signature Recovery:** `_recover` function (assumed to perform signature recovery) verifies the cryptographic signature (`v`, `r`, `s`) against the hash (`digest`) and retrieves the signer's address (`owner`). It ensures that only the owner can approve token transfers.

- **Token Approval:** If the signature is valid (`owner == _recover(...)`), `_approve` function approves the `spender` to transfer the specified `value` of tokens from `owner`.

**Impact:**

- **Usability:** Facilitates meta-transactions by allowing token approvals without requiring on-chain transactions, thereby improving user experience and reducing gas costs.
  
- **Security:** Ensures secure approval of token transfers through cryptographic signature verification, mitigating the risk of unauthorized approvals and enhancing overall protocol security.

### Summary
The `permit` function in the ERC20Permit smart contract provides a robust mechanism for off-chain approvals of token transfers. By leveraging encoding, hashing, and cryptographic signature verification techniques, it enhances usability and security within the DeFi ecosystem, supporting ERC-20 tokens with permit capabilities.
